creator_notes: "I don't even like chess. But for all you sickos out there who do, 
well, I'd rather you indulged here than out in the real world.
<br>
<br>
This stage will allow you to play chess with any bot by saying \"play chess,\" 
or forfeit with \"knock over the board.\" The player is always white.
<br>
<br>
Of course, you'll actually be playing against 
[js-chess-engine's](https://github.com/josefjadrny/js-chess-engine) bundled AI 
and not against the LLM. The stage will manage the game state and make moves, 
and the bot will be informed what has happened so it can respond as though they made that move.
