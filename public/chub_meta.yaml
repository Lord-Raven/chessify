creator_notes: "I don't even like chess. But for all you sickos out there who do, 
well, I'd rather you indulged here than out in the real world.
<br>
<br>
This stage allows you to play chess with any bot by saying \"play chess.\" You will play white and input moves in a coordinate to coordinate format (e.g., \"A2 to A4\"). 
The stage does not understand natural language or algebraic notation (although coordinates and other key words can be embedded in your RP and still function). 
You may also forfeit with \"knock over the board,\" if you tire of the game.
<br>
<br>
I don't yet have any personal bots that I want to attach this to as an example, but you can add it to any chat from the \"Chat Settings\" modal. 
There, you can also adjust a couple of settings: AI difficulty and board scale (note that these require you to refresh the chat before taking effect).
<br>
<br>
You will actually be playing against 
[js-chess-engine's](https://github.com/josefjadrny/js-chess-engine) bundled AI 
and not against the LLM; even with the stage spoon-feeding the LLM a FEN diagram and notes about what is going on, 
it will sometimes say dumb things that do not reflect what is actually occurring on the board. 
In reality, the stage manages the game state and makes moves, 
and the bot is simply informed what is happening so it can try to respond as though it made that move. The bot can suck at this, 
especially if it is compelled to type a lot, but sometimes the responses are surprisingly good and demonstrate that the LLM does have some reasonable chess knowledge in there.
<br>
<br>
2025.09.13 - Fixed a couple bugs, added some basic stuff to combat \"fake\" board rendering by the LLM, and updated dependencies.<br>
2025.03.09 - Finally fixed the display issues by moving away from svg text tags. Addressed a minor bug with discarded pieces not re-calculating on load or swipe."
